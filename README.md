# AlgorithmVisualizer
An Algorithm visualizer made with python and pygame for visualization.  Project started with making sorting algorithms visualized first.  
**Algorithms currently visualized are listed below in order of creation of visualizations.**
## Algorithms:
* Bubble Sort.  
* Insertion Sort.

# Instructions
## Key presses:
* R = Reset. This will reset the graph to be sorted and also pick new random numbers/graph items to be sorted.
* Space Bar = Start sorting. This will begin the sorting process.
* A = Ascending. Sort in ascending order.
* D = Descending. Sort in descending order.


## Issues During/after project and planned improvements:
* Preventing overlapping pixels. (Solved)
* Descending order for Insertion sort not working. (Solved)
* Cant pause sorting process, dosent stop till completed once begun. (Solved)
* Sorting should stop and reset if reset is hit during sorting. (Solved)
* put algorithm selection in drop down menu to allow for better UI when more are added.
