# AlgorithmVisualizer
An Algorithm visualizer made with python and pygame for visualization.  Project started with making sorting algorithms visualized first.  
**Algorithms currently visualized are listed below in order of creation of visualizations.**
## Algorithms:
* Bubble Sort.  
* Insertion Sort.

# Instructions
## Key presses:
* R = Reset. This will reset the graph to be sorted and also pick new random numbers/graph items to be sorted.

* Space Bar = Start sorting. This will begin the sorting process.
